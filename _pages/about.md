<!-- Hi! I am an M.S./Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) under the supervision of Prof. <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/members/jaesik/"><u>Jaesik Choi</u></a>. My research interests lie in deep reinforcement learning, particularly unsupervised RL and curriculum RL. I am also involved in a wide range of other projects, such as autonomous navigation in crowded environment, devising strategies for curling games and change point detection. -->

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr"><u>SAIL</u></a> at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) under the supervision of Prof. <a style="color:DodgerBlue" href="http://sailab.kaist.ac.kr/members/jaesik/"><u>Jaesik Choi</u></a>. My long-term research goal is to develop reliable and scalable reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
